### User and roles
In our AppStartupRunner we have created two roles, two users and a few authorities (rights). 
####Pre defined roles and authorities:
- ROLE_ADMIN
    - CRUD for ALL users
  
- ROLE_DEFAULT
    -  CRUD for himself
    - every user can lookup other users, but will get public info only (Extra feature :D)
